# 🛡️ Reward Function Testing Tool

## Project Overview

An innovative framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of AI systems by rigorously evaluating reward functions for unintended consequences. This tool empowers researchers, developers, and AI practitioners to identify misalignments early, ensuring trustworthy AI systems that align with human value.


## 🚀 Features

🔧 Input Custom Reward Functions
Seamlessly define reward functions tailored to specific AI tasks (e.g., optimizing human productivity).

🤖 Automated Robustness Testing
Execute comprehensive tests to detect vulnerabilities where the reward function may be gamed, misused, or misinterpreted.

🧪 Edge & Corner Case Generation
Automatically generate critical test cases to uncover potential failure modes and ensure system resilience.

💡 Actionable Recommendations
Provides intelligent suggestions to refine reward functions, mitigate risks, and strengthen alignment with intended outcomes.

## 📌 Example

When testing a reward function designed to “help humans be more productive,” the tool proactively flags risks such as:

Prioritizing excessive screen time over meaningful output.

Eliminating essential breaks, compromising long-term well-being.

Promoting shortcuts that yield short-term gains but cause long-term harm.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 🐍

Core: Reinforcement Learning + Simulation Frameworks.

Testing: Automated scenario and edge-case generation.

Reports: Structured diagnostics & recommendations.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Reward functions define agent behavior in reinforcement learning. If poorly designed, they can lead to reward hacking, unsafe actions, or misaligned outcomes.
This project demonstrates expertise in:

✅ AI safety & alignment.

✅ Rigorous testing methodologies.

✅ Building reliable, human-centric AI systems.
